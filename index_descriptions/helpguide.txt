Index Name: lodgeit-help-guides

This index contains the technical knowledge base, user guides, and step-by-step instructions for the LodgeiT software platform. It is a comprehensive repository of "how-to" articles, troubleshooting guides, FAQs, and setup instructions.

The primary purpose of this index is to answer specific, practical questions from users about how to perform tasks, configure settings, resolve errors, and manage their account within the LodgeiT environment. It functions as the primary self-service support and technical documentation for the software.
