Index Name: lodgeit-pricing
This index contains detailed pricing, plan structures, and feature lists for LodgeiT, an Australian cloud-based software platform for tax agents, accountants, bookkeepers, and businesses. The data is exclusively focused on the commercial offerings of the LodgeiT service, detailing what features are included in which plans and at what cost. It is a product and pricing catalog.

The primary function of this data is to answer user queries about the cost, features, and target audience of different LodgeiT subscription plans and pay-as-you-go services. All pricing is in Australian Dollars (AUD) and includes GST where specified.

Key Entities and Concepts
LodgeiT: The software product itself.

Lodgment: A core unit of service. This refers to the act of submitting a single official form to a regulatory body, such as the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). Examples include submitting a Company Tax Return or a Business Activity Statement (BAS).

Plan/Subscription: A package of services with specific allowances and features, usually billed annually (e.g., Nano, Starter, Professional).

On Demand / Pay as you go: A pricing model where users pay for each service or "lodgment" individually, without an annual subscription fee.

Forms: Specific types of documents that can be lodged, such as "Company tax return," "Trust tax return," "SMSF annual return," "Activity statement (BAS)," and "Taxable payments annual report (TPAR)."
