### What is the Medicare Levy?

The **Medicare Levy** is a tax imposed on Australian taxpayers to help fund the country's public healthcare system, known as Medicare. It is calculated as a percentage of your taxable income and is generally set at **2%** of your taxable income. However, the amount you pay can vary depending on your income level, family circumstances, and whether you qualify for any exemptions or reductions.

### Key Points About the Medicare Levy:

1. **Purpose**:  
   The Medicare Levy ensures that Australians contribute to the funding of Medicare, which provides access to public healthcare services.

2. **Calculation**:  
   The levy is based on your **taxable income**. If your income is below a certain threshold, you may qualify for a reduction or exemption. For example, if your taxable income is less than **$39,402**, the Medicare Levy may be reduced to **$0**.
